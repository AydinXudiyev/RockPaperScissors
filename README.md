 # Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification  This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of rock, paper, and scissors gestures. The model is trained with data augmentation for improved generalization and achieves multi-class classification across the three gestures
